                                    Fibonacci Retracements: Helps identify strategic levels of support and resistance.
                                    Custom Algorithms: Incorporates unique algorithms that focus on market sentiment, providing a nuanced understanding of market dynamics.
                                
                                Machine Learning Integration: At the core of the project is a machine learning pipeline that processes and analyzes the data to automatically generate buying or selling signals based on the inputted stock or cryptocurrency data.
                                
                                Modular Design: The project is structured in a modular fashion, allowing for ease of updates and scalability. Initial explorations and analyses are performed in Jupyter notebooks, with findings then encapsulated into classes to streamline the data pipeline.
                                
                                Objective
                                
                                The primary goal of IndicatorsStockCryptoAlgo is to provide a reliable, automated system for financial market predictions that investors can use to inform their trading decisions. This system aims to reduce the complexity associated with financial market analysis and make high-quality, data-driven investment insights accessible to both novice and experienced traders. Usage
                                
                                To use this project, simply input the desired stock or cryptocurrency data, and the system will analyze the information using the integrated technical indicators and machine learning models to output predictive buying or selling signals. Future Scope
                                
                                Enhancement of Algorithm Accuracy: Continuous improvement of the algorithms through training with new data sets and refining existing models.
                                User Interface Development: Plans to develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily interact with the system and retrieve real-time insights.
                                Expand Indicator Range: Incorporate additional technical indicators and data points to enhance predictive accuracy.

                            <h3>HandshakeCapture</h3>
                            <p>My latest development, the Network Handshake Capturer, is a sophisticated security tool designed to intercept and capture network handshakes, particularly from WiFi networks. Built using Python and enhanced with a Tkinter graphical user interface, this tool provides essential functionalities for security professionals and network administrators. Users can easily specify the wireless interface, AP MAC address, and the channel they wish to monitor, making it versatile for various testing scenarios.

                                This project not only showcases my proficiency in programming and network security but also demonstrates my ability to create practical, user-focused tools that cater to the needs of the cybersecurity community. The Network Handshake Capturer is pivotal for conducting network security assessments, facilitating the capture of handshakes that are critical for identifying vulnerabilities and enhancing network security protocols.</p>

                            <p>The Password Manager project is a C++ application designed to securely manage passwords for different websites. It includes the following key functionalities:

                                Add Password: Stores a password for a specified website.
                                Remove Password: Deletes the stored password for a given website.
                                Retrieve Password: Fetches the password for a specified website.
                                List All Passwords: Displays all stored site-password pairs.
                                Generate Random Password: Creates a strong, random password of a specified length using a mix of characters, including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special symbols.
                            
                            The implementation uses standard C++ libraries for input/output operations, random number generation, and data storage in an unordered map. The code is structured with a class (PasswordManager) that encapsulates all the functionalities, ensuring a clean and modular design.</p>

                            <p>I'm developing a sentiment analysis application designed to track sentiment for stocks and cryptocurrencies. The project aims to be versatile, with plans to encapsulate it in a container for easy integration into various projects. In the future, it will be adaptable for inclusion in pipelines, or potentially be expanded into an API or library for broader use. This flexibility will allow for seamless integration and reuse in different contexts and projects.</p>
